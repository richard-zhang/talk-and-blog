### competitive programming introduction
- sharp problem solving skills
  - reducing the given problem to a knwn problem
  - identifying subtle hints or special properties in the problem
  - attacking the problem from a non obvious angle
basis time/space complexity analysis technique
- nested loop
- recursive call (b call with n level )
- dynamic programming
Refrain from coding until you are sure that your algorithm is both correct and fast enough
