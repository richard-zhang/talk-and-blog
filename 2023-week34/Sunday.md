- Functional High-Performance and Numerical Computing (FHPNC)
  - Groq TSP chip
    - groq is the company
    - TSP (Tensor Streaming Processor)
      - predictable performance 
      - most sillicon are used for memory and arithmetic logic unit
  - focus on matrix multiplication
  - Rank-Polymorphism
    - +\*\\- operator will work on scalar as well vector
