# Talk [C++ Concepts vs Rust Traits vs Haskell Typeclasses vs Swift Protocols - Conor Hoekstra - ACCU 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPVoCTgvi8M&list=WL&index=2&t=1s)


1. There is something you can learn from a particular languages
2. I love ALL programming languages

C++ concepts

* Protocol-oriented Programming in Swift
   * basically type-class

* Swift and C++ relationship
* Digression

* Constrained Generics

* C++ + Haskell + Love = Rust

* Two types of parametric
  * Ad-hoc polymorphism occurs when a function is defined over several different types, acting in a different way for each type.
  * Parametric polymorphism occurs when a function is defined over a range of types, acting in the same way for each type.

* Type Constraints are to Types as Types are to Values

* There is std::identity function object in c++

* Possible example of ad-hoc polymorphism in c++
  * function overloading
  * template specialization

# How to make ad-hoc polymorphism less ad-hoc?
* Ad-hoc polymorphism

# Better Algorithm Intuition

## partition
std::partition = Two finger method
std::stable_partition

How to implement a stable_partition?

## sort
sort => partial_sort (partial_sort_copy) => nth_element

## adjacent_find
* return an iterator to the first of the first pair such that *it == *(it + 1)

## Log(N) algorithm in algorithm
* binary_search
* lower/upper_bound
* partition_point
  * the first element that does not satisfy predicate p
  * last element if all elements satisfy p
* equal_range
  * combination of lower_bound and upper_bound 
  * return two iterators
* partition
```cpp
template<class ForwardIt, class UnaryPredicate>
ForwardIt partition(ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last, UnaryPredicate p)
{
  first = std::find_if_not(first, last, p);
  if (first == last) return first
  for(ForwardIt i = std::next(first); i != last; ++i)
  {
    if (p(*i))
    {
      std::iter_swap(first, i);
      ++first;
    }
  }
  return first
}
```

* transform in C++ is zipWith, map in haskell 

* worst name in stl algorithm header
  * mismatch -> zip_find
  * adjacent_difference -> adjacent_transform
  * 

* some interesting functor in C++ 17
  * ```std::not_fn(pred)```
  * https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/functional

## Digression
* print a vector
```cpp
std::copy(std::cbegin(vec),
          std::cend(vec),
          std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, ", "));
```
