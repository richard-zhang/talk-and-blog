## Effect system tutorial

* `val perform : 'a eff -> 'a`
* `val continue : ('a, 'b) continuation -> 'a -> 'b`

Note:
* `'a` in perform and continue are matched. They represent the same things. continue will pass the actual value to the perform hence complete the type signature for `perform` in terms of where to get the `'a`
* continue give the perform the return value

For compilers to find libffi you may need to set:
  set -gx LDFLAGS "-L/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib"
  set -gx CPPFLAGS "-I/usr/local/opt/libffi/include"
* [gdb and lldb comparison](https://lldb.llvm.org/use/map.html)
* display symbol table `nm -an foo`
* [nm symbol type](https://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man1/nm.1.asp)
* br s -n caml_perform
* br s -n caml_resume
* difference between Printf.printf and print_endline
  * [print_endline](https://ocaml.org/api/Stdlib.html) will call flush automatically
  * [printf](https://ocaml.org/api/Printf.html) need to call flush with `!`
  * flush
    * flush the buffer associated with the given channel and perform all **pending** writes on that channels

For pkg-config to find libffi you may need to set:
  set -gx PKG_CONFIG_PATH "/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"

* effect are unchecked
  * A program that does not handle a performed effect fails with a `runtime exception`

* effect and exception
  * exception handler are effect handler without continuation
  * usage of discontinue is interesting
    * the 

* A way to implement an effect system is to via free monadic interpretation

* OCaml ambiguous type
  * https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/gadt-question-it-would-escape-the-scope-of-its-equation/2876/3
  * Here, by the scope of its equation, the compiler actually means the scope of the Sst branch, where the type of arg could be either 'a or state. Normally, the compiler uses heuristics to resolve such ambiguities, so it is sufficient to annotate on the function level

* Implemented on top of fibers
  * small, heap, allocated stack chunks


## Type safe printf Implementation in OCaml
1. [printf-gadt](https://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/proposals/formats-as-gadts.pdf)
2. [slides](https://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/slides/vaugon.pdf)

* Use GADT instead raw string to represent format at runtime "Hello %d%!"
  * hence is statically computed and pre-allocated in the data segment by the OCaml compilers.

## Blog PDF [EPOLL is fundamentally broken](https://idea.popcount.org/2017-02-20-epoll-is-fundamentally-broken-12/) Using TCP Through Sockets

Operations:
* accept: server side received this a connection request with IP address and port number from client is sent
* read: block until some data is available in the socket receive buffer

Scenarios:
* Scaling out accept to serve a high number of TCP connections
  * time to establish a TCP connection is predictable
  * better to use multi-thread to handle
* Scaling out the number of read
  * Each connection require some unpredictable processing, so sharing them into the equal buckets
    * Another reason for async service 
    * unpredictable processing for different asset class

* combined queue methods
  * one queue multiple consumers

### Using TCP Through Sockets
Random note:
1. cntl stands for control
* Unix file I/O
  * Most I/O takes place through the read and write system calls
* the use of sockets to communicate over a network using TCP
  * TCP is the reliable protocol to communicate over the Interrnet.
  * Provides a stream abstractions 
    * Two process can communicate data by owned a separate file descriptor via read/write sys calls
  * Network file descriptors are called sockets
  * IP address identify a machine on a 
  * PORT number identify a TCP connection on a machine
    * cat etc/services | grep 80/tcp => http 80/tcp www www-http # World Wide Web HTTP
* TCP server/client programming
  * Server: Socket -> Bind -> Accept -> Read/Write -> Close
  * Client: Socket -> (Bind) -> Connect -> Read/Write -> Close
  * localhost 127.0.0.1
* Non-blocking IO
