# Effect system tutorial 

## Session 4

* continuation is first class value
* generator: control of traversal is retained on the client side, client decided whether it's required to get the next element
* iterator: control of traversal is retained on the library side
* Gotcha when implementing **generator out of iterator with effect** Exception Continuation_already_taken.
  * continuation should only be called once
  * shall reset the continuation state after the iterator has finished traversing

## Session 5: Cooperative threading in effect

* Async, Lwt -> concurrency monad -> program must be written in monadic style
* Main benefit
  * the code could be written in direct style but with the benefit of Async I/O
  * Similar to Goroutines in Go but implementation is library wise instead of language wise
    * more flexible
    * similar to c++ coroutine
* queue
  * first-in, first-out
  * Explanation of pattern matching
    * when async effect, the current task (continuation) is enqueued to the end and async task is run 
    * when yield effect, the current task is enqueued to the end of queue and the top of queue is run
    * when matching anything: an async task is finished hence pop the queue to run the next task
  * run function terminates when the queue is empty
  * evolution of the queue
  * task are function that takes a unit and return anything with effect to 1) spawn new task and 2) yield
* Async/Await
  * promise as a list of tasks waiting on this promise to resolve or Done

## Session 6:
* event loop use select to check any fd is available to read or write

## Blog [Beyond Lwy promises](http://jobjo.github.io/2020/07/01/beyond-lwt-promises.html)

* LWT
  * Lwt promises are eagerly evaluated
  * there is a global context that knows about all Lwt promises and executes them explicitly or implicitly

* Orchestration
  * if two program (Lwt) are defined outside the scope of the monadic composition, they could start executing in the background concurrently

* LWT - Not Referential transparency

* LWT - Not Lazy
  * Workaround - Lwt.t => unit -> 'a Lwt.t

* Improvement
  * Still rely on Lwt machinery for scheduling
  * Semantics evolve from promise to unevaluated actions
    * Promise - A mutable reference that may or may not contain a value and if not, may eventually be filled with a value or an exception
    * Action - represent a computation that when run may produce a value
