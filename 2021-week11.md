# Blog [Why asynchronous Rust doesn't work](Why asynchronous Rust doesn't work)

* In rust, function has different type than closure
  * ```expected fn pointer, found closure```
* the type of closure cannot be named
* similar to c++
  * use generic to deal with things whose type cannot be named
  * closure type cannot be named but they implement one of the `Fn` family of traits
* three rules when holding a refernce & or &mut
  * outlives
  * doesn't move
  * no conflicting
* Rust is not a language where first-class functions are ergonomic

# Blog [What color is your function](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)

* Every function has a color
  * Either red or blue
  * call function according to its color
  * can call a blue function within red
  * can't call a red function within blue
  * red functions are more painful to call
  * Some core library functions are red


Red functions are asynchronous ones
  

Solution
  * Iter0 Callback hell
    * synchronous functions return values, async ones invoke callbacks
  * Iter1 promise/futures
  * Iter3 async/await
    * synchronous functions return values async ones return Task<T> or Future<T>

Language that doesn't have the color problem
* It isn't strictly necessary for them to be operating system threads
  * green thread
* How do you pick up where you left off when an operation completes

await is a mark for compiler to make it CPS-transform

* closure and objects are equivalent

* suspend

* with callbacks/promises/async-await => you ultimately end up taking your asynchronous function and smearing it out into a bunch of closures that live over in the heap.

* (A is B) insofar that (C is D)
