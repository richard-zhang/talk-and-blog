# [LDN Functionals #8 KC Sivaramakrishnan: OCaml multicore and programming with Reagents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRWTws_YPBA)

* OCaml Multi-core
  * Add latest support for concurrency and parallelism to OCaml
  * Concurrency
    * A programming structuring mechanism
    * Overlapping IO
  * Parallelism
    * multi-core

* Concurrent: Fibers => Effects => Cooperative threading libraries
* Parallelism: Domain => Lock-free programming

* Compare-and-swap (CAS) based solution
  * really hard to compose

* Reagents
  * sequential >>> - software transactional memory
  * Parallel <*> - Join Calculus
  * Select   <+>

```ml
type 'a ref
val upd : 'a ref -> f:('a -> 'b -> ('a * 'c) option) -> ('b, 'c) Reagent.t
```

* Composability
  * transform arbitrary blocking reagent to a non-blocking reagent `let try_pop stack = attempt (pop stack)`

# [Multi-core Ocaml - What's coming in 2021](https://speakerdeck.com/kayceesrk/multicore-ocaml-whats-coming-in-2021)

* Domains for shared memory parallelism
* Effect handlers for concurrent programming

Domain
- Maps to OS thread
- Low-level domain API
  * spawn & join
  * Memory model is special which  support atomic memory operations
  * Bounding Data Races in Space and Time
- No restrictions on sharing objects between domains

Stock OCaml GC

Domainslib
* Task: working stealing task pool with async/await parallelism and parallel_{for, scan} 
* Channels

* Async/Await is just an interface it cna be used for parallelism as well

* LWT
  * Essentially, it do asynchronous IO and attach a callback to IO operation
  * Callback-oriented programming with nicer syntax
  * Pitfalls
    * No back traces
    * exceptions can't be used
    * Monadic syntax
  
* Go (goroutines) and GHC Haskell (threads)
  * lightweight threads

* Should we add light-threads to OCaml?

Concurrency is a program structuring mechanism

Non-local control-flow mechanisms
  * what's it? Cause the flow of execution to jump out of a given context and resume at some pre-declared points
  * Exceptions, (Generators/Coroutines), exception, async IO

[Effect Handler](https://kcsrk.info/slides/handlers_edinburgh.pdf):
* Add a keyword "effect"
  * so that Effect declaration separate from interpretation
* Another definition of fiber - lightweight stack

* Generator/Iterator
  * Generator - non-continuous traversal of data structure by yielding values

* wrk2 for performance testing

[Effect Handler in Multi-core ocaml](https://kcsrk.info/slides/WASM_CG_4Aug20.pdf)
* talk about compiler translation (static semantics)
* effect E : string
* `val perform : 'a eff -> 'a`
* `val continue : ('a, 'b) continuation -> 'a -> 'b`

# Blog [Developers spend most of their time figuring the system out](https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/)

* "figuring out" times
  * Comprehension
  * Navigation

* Asking why
  * Comprehension is reading
  * Why read code => figure the situation enough to know what to do next 
  * reading is just about which information is gathered from data
    * most manual way
    * system is just data

* Assessment
  * process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision
